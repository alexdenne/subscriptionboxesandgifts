The National Trust Beer Club aims to bring you the very best craft beer and cider from around the UK.

While most other countries offer mainly mainstream lagers, thanks to the recent rise in small craft breweries, Britain now has enormous diversity; golden ales, bitters, milds, porters, stouts, old ales, strong ales, IPA's and wheat beers to name just a few.

Today, with more small breweries per head than any other major industrialised nation, British beer is leading the way in craft food and drink, as more of us seek out local products with genuine provenance.
