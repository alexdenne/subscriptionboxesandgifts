Our expert beer tasters are continuing our founder's adventure by tasting the most cutting edge beers from around the world. Craft beer is experimental - some make the grade, while others don't - we only feature our favourites in your box. You'll never drink bad beer again.

Gone are the days of watery, fizzy, tin cans of nothingness. Craft beer is rebellious, anti-establishment and witty. A good craft beer takes ingenuity and imagination to brew.

An army of thousands are tinkering and tweaking. Inventing, discovering and creating. Strong beers, fruity beers, hoppy beers, all for you to discover.

Free yourself from big beer brand slavery.
Enliven your beer fridge.
Send your tastebuds on the ultimate craft beer road trip.
